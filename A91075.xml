            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>UR <hi>dear Lord, in the dayes of his fleſh</hi> ſpake many words privately among his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to this effect, <hi>viz.</hi> that they ſhould be hated of the world, that they ſhould be hated of all men for his Names ſake: yea, and in that laſt ſolemn Addreſſe to his father, related, <hi>John</hi> the ſeventeenth (wherein he hath left upon record a pattern of his interceſſion on the Behalfe of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, who did then <hi>or ſhould afterward beleeve on him through their word</hi>) he doth expreſly mention this matter, (ſurely his heart was full of it and much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it) <hi>I have given them thy word</hi> (ſayeth
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118692:3"/>hee there to his father) and <hi>THE WORLD HATH HATED THEM becauſe they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</hi> And againe in a certaine place hee teſtifieth ſaying, If the <hi>WORLD HA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TETH YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>,</hi> yee know that <hi>IT HATED ME be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it HATED YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>, If yee were of the world the world would love its owne, but becauſe yee are not of the world, but I have choſen you out of the world, therefore</hi> THE WORLD HATETH YOU. Now to beare up their hearts under this Burthen of the <hi>Hatred of the world,</hi> he puts them in mind of that leſſon, which hee had formerly taught them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.24. <hi>John</hi> 13.16. ſaying, <hi>Remember the word that I ſayed to you: the ſervant is not greater then the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If they have perſecuted mee they will preſecute you alſo, if they have kept my ſaying, they will keepe yours alſo.</hi> The ſpirit and life of the incouragement lyeth in this, that the Son of God was their <hi>Brother and companion in Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> and in ſuffering the hatred of the world, they ſhould drinke out of the ſame cup with him in all the afflictions which they were to indure from the world. Now if any Man, that obſerves the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderableneſſe of theſe and many other paſſages of this Nature, ſhould deſire to know the particular reaſon why the Lord Jeſus (with his Diſciples) was allwayes thus hated, perſecuted and Abaſed by the world, Did Hee and they give any juſt Cauſe of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and ill-will againſt them? I anſwere, no ſurely, there were never a more innocent and harmeleſſe ſort of people in the world then they, But the true reaſon of this inveterate hatred is expreſſed by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <hi>John</hi> the 7 <hi>and</hi> 7. in a Conference betwixt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his Bretheren which did not beleeve in him. <hi>The world</hi> (ſayeth Hee) <hi>cannot hate you but me it hateth
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118692:3"/>becauſe I teſtifie of it (or concerning it) that the workes thereof are evil.</hi> Obſerve the matter ſeriouſly, and you will well perceive, that the world hath workes of its own, the world is full of its owne proper workes, doings and bufineſſe, which it is alltoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther converſant about, Things which it muſt mind and manage, with all care and Induſtry: then ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider, theſe workes are ſuch as are exceedingly beloved and delighted in by the world, and the world cannot indure with any patience that any ſort of men ſhould account them <hi>evill workes;</hi> but then <hi>thirdly</hi> if any ſhould preſume not only to <hi>Account,</hi> but alſo to <hi>Call</hi> them <hi>evill workes,</hi> and ſo teſtifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them as <hi>evill workes</hi> and odious in the ſight of God; for ſuch a Teſtimony though given by the Son of God himſelfe (who for this purpoſe came into the world, that hee might beare witnes: to the truth) would the world hate him, and perſecute him even unto death, if not hindred by the overruling power of God himſelfe.</p>
            <p>And therefore if the true Diſciples of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe (who having his Spirit, his Truth, his Cauſe, his Glory and all his precious Concernments dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and working in them mightily, are conſtrained, by the power of his love, to ſecond and confirme This his great Teſtimony againſt the <hi>world</hi> and the <hi>wicked workes</hi> thereof) ſhould incurr the ſame hatred, indignation and wrath from the world, which was meaſured out unto him, they muſt by no meanes think it a ſtrange thing, but rather rejoyce exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly in their being thus made conformable to the <hi>fathers firſt borne among many Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And bleſſed be the Name of the Lord, that there are any among us, who are counted worthy to ſuffer
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118692:4"/>ſhame and violent Dealing for his Name, and for their. Teſtimony concerning the world, that the workes or Deeds thereof are evill.</p>
            <p>But will it not bee well worthy your time and leiſure to inquire into theſe two or three particulars, firſt, what doth the Lord Jeſus underſtand in the Scriptures before mentioned by the word <hi>world.</hi> Secondly what are thoſe evill workes which our Lord teſtified againſt in the dayes of his fleſh; and Thirdly what is the nature of the Teſtimony of Chriſt and his Diſciples that the world ſhould be ſo much incenſed with hatred and indignation againſt them for it, Hearken oh yee Children of men, and conſider with all your might and with all ſpeed, for the time of Conſideration is allmoſt ſpent and paſſed away. To the Firſt I ſhall return this Account, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly by the word <hi>world</hi> in the Scripture menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, a Certaine part of mankinde, namely the dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate part, the worſt part contra-diſtinguiſhed from the Beſt, namely the Church is here to be underſtood, for the Church and the world, are Contrary one unto the other, evermore.</p>
            <p>This degenerate part of the world or of mankind I diſtinguiſh thus, ſome of them, are ſuch as having departed from the light and Law of Nature, did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward by degrees degenerate into Brutiſhnes, and profannes, as namely, the nations of the earth, which neither worſhip God, nor love their Neighbour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the written rule, but live and walke after their own and their Rulers luſts and inventions in all things; being full as of all ungodlineſſe, ſo of all unrighteouſneſſe likewiſe, as may be obſerved once for all, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. from the 18 verſe to the end of the Chapter. Theſe Gentiles <hi>in the poynt of Government
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118692:4"/>and worſhip</hi> have not <hi>Jehovah for their Judge, or their Law-giver, or their King,</hi> but have in a conſtant ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion ſubmitted to the <hi>foure Beaſts which roſe out of the great Sea</hi> (as is deſcribed by <hi>Daniel</hi> the Prophet) as to their Soveraigne Lords in all things.</p>
            <p>Others of the degenerate part of Mankind, are ſuch as having been taken into Covenant with God, from among the Idolatrous Nations, <hi>to be his Church and people,</hi> did for a time obſerve and doe his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, but afterward forſaking the Lord their God, have joyned themſelves to Idols, after the manner of the Nations of the world, and ſo have gradually degenerated into the very Image and ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of the <hi>Gentiles which know not God,</hi> and ſo are of the world, as the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were of the world, and as the <hi>Canaanites</hi> were of the world. This was the ſtate of the Ten Tribes, and this ſtate is notably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in <hi>Jeremy</hi> the 2 from the 9 to the 21 verſe.</p>
            <p>Such alſo were the degenerate Members of the Jewiſh Church in the firſt day of the <hi>Son of man, they were of the world,</hi> as the Romans and the Grecians <hi>were of the world;</hi> and therefore without controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie our Lord in the forementioned paſſages, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude within the compaſſe of the word WORLD, the Order of the Prieſts (from the Higheſt to the Loweſt) the whole ſtate of the Elders, the whole Hypocriticall Generation of the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, and the Generality of the people, who being corrupted from the ſimplicity and purity of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitutions, did not long after the Teſtimony aforeſaid, Joyne in the Murthering of the Lord of glory: <hi>This is the world which hated Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> even with a more perfect hatred, then <hi>Herod,</hi> or <hi>Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> [or the Centurions, or the Souldiers of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118692:5"/>Theſe Things are plain and clear to almoſt every underſtanding, and therefore I for bear further explication.</p>
            <p>Only let me add this. <hi>As it was then even ſo it is now,</hi> in theſe our dayes, as by many Inſtances it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
            <p>That the Turks are of the world, that the Jews are of the world (and not of the Church) that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, the Indians, the Moores are of the world as the nations before the day of Chriſt, were of the world is Confeſſed by us all: But is it not as true? that the Idolatrous, the prophane, the Brutiſh, the Barbarous Papiſts are of the world, as the Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are of the world? (though they pretend to be the only true Church of God upon earth) this alſo will be aſſented to as the Truth among the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants; they may beleeve upon Scripture ground, that the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> as now degenerated, muſt needes be very neere of Kin, to the <hi>Heatheniſh world,</hi> becauſe the <hi>ſpirit of the world</hi> and the <hi>Characters of the world,</hi> workes effectually in them, and is plainly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned upon them, as in and upon others of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Diſobedience.</p>
            <p>But now what ſhall wee ſay of the <hi>Proteſtant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> of the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> which have a name to live, to bee the Spouſe of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wee cannot indure to heare them evill ſpoken of, wee cannot beare it that they ſhould be looked upon as the world, or the worldly Church, or the Carnal Church, theſe are odious expreſſions, they and their ſtate are not to bee compared with the ſtate of the Jewiſh Church as our Lord found it when he teſtified that they were the world and that their workes were evill.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:118692:5"/>
To this, with an holy Boldnes as in the ſight of Chriſt, I dare to ſay, that in their preſent Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Condition they may, without doing them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wrong, be compared to the Jewiſh Church and ſtate in the Dayes of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their ſuperſtitions and perſecutions, of their hatred and enmity to the pure wayes of Chriſt as the popiſh Church, may be juſtly compared to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate Ten tribes in reſpect of their Idolatryes and perſecutions; for this is a moſt certain truth, full of evidence in it ſelfe, where you find the ſpirit of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, Superſtition, Tradition, Ceremony and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality in worſhip prevailing, and overpowring the true Goſpel ſpirit, there will you find the ſpirit of the world. Moreover where the Lord Jeſus and his Members feele the power of the ſpirit of injuſtice and opreſſion of hatred and perſecution overcoming the ſpirit of truth and equity, of righteouſnes and innocency, there they may ſafely ſay, theſe Men are the men of the world, and ſo no other, no better then the world.</p>
            <p>Now then forbearing to inquire into the ſtate of the reformed Churches abroad, let us take a ſhort ſurvay of the nationall Churches of <hi>England,</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> which are accounted in the Number of the Reformed Churches, and their Daughters the Pariſh Churches, as they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly or are now Conſtituted and Governed by the Lords Spirituall the Lord Byſhops the Lord Preſbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the Lord Triers under <hi>Charles R.</hi> and <hi>Oliver P.</hi> thoſe two proteſtant Princes thoſe two Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the faith, thoſe two ſupream Heades (ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively) of the Church in theſe parts of the Earth with all their Eccleſiaſticall furniture of Church
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118692:6"/>officers patrons, Parſons, Vicars, Curates, Church Wardens, Clearks, Sextons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not to omit all their Pariſh and Collegiate-Church members. Did they formerly or doe they now looke like the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſt, or like the Churches of Antichriſt? were they not, are they not, of the world? did they not, doe they not ſpeake of the world? as ſayeth the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn,</hi> yea all of them, from the Head to the tayle? as ſayeth the Prophet <hi>Iſayah.</hi> Were they not, are they not now againe (under the ſhadow of their Lord protectors wings) Conſtituted Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced, maintained and Governed after the Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, after the traditions of Antichriſt, <hi>after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ?</hi> doe not theſe Churches and their officers worſhip the Lord in vaine, teaching for Doctrines the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Men? nay more then this, did they not in the Prelates dayes, doe they not in the dayes of the preſent Tryers appeare full of the ſpirit of enmity againſt the wayes of Chriſt, againſt the Kingdom of Chriſt, againſt the Government of Chriſt, and his Legiſlative power? is there not now, as formerly a great and a generall hatred among the Scribes and the Phariſees, and the Corrupt Lawyers, againſt the new non-conformiſts, &amp; nonſubſcribers, and againſt all thoſe who in the ſpirit of Chriſt ſhall boldly beare witnes that they are the world, and not the Church, and that their workes are evill? Let thoſe who are ſpirituall conſider the matter, and ſpeake their mind. Let thoſe whoſe ſenſes are exerciſed, by reaſon of uſe, to diſcerne betwixt Chriſt and <hi>Beliall,</hi> betwixt the Inventions of men and the Injunctions of God, well weigh the premiſes in the balance of the Sanctuary and give judgement according to God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:118692:6"/>
But to haſten to the <hi>ſecond Question,</hi> What were thoſe EVILL WORKS, which our Lord did te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie againſt, or for which he did bear witneſs againſt the world, and for doing whereof, <hi>he was hated of the world?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer. Without Controverſie, THOSE E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VILL WORKS may be reduced to <hi>two or three ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Heads.</hi> Either ſuch as were wrought by them in the <hi>way of an</hi> ECCLESIASTICALL BODY, or ſuch as were brought forth in the <hi>Manner and Method of a</hi> CIVILL STATE, or elſe ſuch as were done by the <hi>confuſion and mixture of</hi> ALL <hi>together,</hi> as the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> in that notable Prayer of <hi>Peter</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, where all ſorts of Intereſts, <hi>Civill, Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, Military,</hi> are declared to Combine together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Lord. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.27. <hi>Of a truth againſt thy holy Servant Jeſus, whom thou haſt anointed, both HE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROD, and PONTI<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S PILATE, with the GENTILES, and the PEOPLE of Iſrael were gathered together.</hi> Here is a Combination in the <hi>Church,</hi> in the <hi>Court,</hi> in the <hi>CAMP,</hi> againſt the Saviour of the world. And upon examination of the <hi>works</hi> and <hi>workings</hi> of all theſe parties, we ſhall find cauſe to ſay they were to be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified againſt as <hi>Evill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But more particularly, to reckon up ſome of them as we find them occaſionally recorded by the <hi>foure Evangeliſts</hi> (and, as we goe along, to compare them with thoſe evill works which are now carried on in theſe parts of the earth) as done by the <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> by <hi>Herod,</hi> by <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> by the <hi>Gentlemen of the long Robe of both profeſſions,</hi> &amp;c. Firſt, let us begin with their <hi>Counſells against Chriſt,</hi> thoſe works of darkneſſe, they are <hi>evill works within doores,</hi> Mat. 12.14. <hi>The Phariſees went out, and held a Counſel (privately) how
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118692:7"/>they might deſtroy him.</hi> Here were conſultations held againſt the life of Chriſt. So <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.1. <hi>All the chief Prieſts, and Elders of the people tooke counſel againſt Jeſus, to put him to death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhall have an exact account of all their wicked murtherous Conſultations againſt <hi>the Perſon, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, the Honour of the Lord Jeſus, in that day when he ſhall Judge the ſecrets of all men, according to his Goſpel.</hi> But in the mean time we know that theſe <hi>Deeds of Darkneſſe,</hi> were ſome of thoſe <hi>evill workes,</hi> which our Lord did teſtifie againſt.</p>
            <p>And in like manner, at this day we know (in that light of truth which will not faile us) that there are many cloſe &amp; cunning conſultations to deſtroy that Cauſe of Chriſt which not long ſince was, in ſhew, highly honoured, and contended for, by him, who is known by the name of his <hi>Highneſs the Lord Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi> &amp;c. but who gave him that Name, I leave to him to Anſwer, when he ſhall be called to a ſtrict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for all the evil counſel given againſt the Lord, and his followers, becauſe of their righteous reproofs of the Army and their Generall, for the Hypocriſie, Apoſtacy, Oppreſſion, and Perſecutions, whereof they are guilty in the ſight of the Sun.</p>
            <p>Another kind of <hi>evill works,</hi> was their <hi>watching of the Lord Jeſus, and ſending forth Spies, which ſhould feign themſelves juſt men, that they might take hold of his words, that ſo they might deliver him to the power and Authority of the Governour,</hi> Luke 20.20. And the Scribes and Phariſees (<hi>Luke</hi> 11.53.) <hi>urged him vehemently, and provoked him to ſpeak of many Things, laying wait for him, and ſeeking to catch ſomething out of his mouth, that they might accuſe him.</hi> Certainly every man who loves the Lord Jeſus, will eaſily grant theſe were <hi>very wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118692:7"/>workes.</hi> But are not ſuch practiſes frequently uſed by the Spies, which are Imployed from the Court and Council at <hi>White Hall?</hi> I am ſure before our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, Many who came to catch our words, feigned themſelves to be Juſt men, to be good men, whereby they were capeable to intangle us in our talke. The ſame Spirit which wrought effectually in thoſe children of diſobedience, doth work in theſe as effectually, and we doubt not but we ſhall prove theſe Spies to be guilty of the <hi>ſame evill workes,</hi> with thoſe Spies which watched Chriſt, and their Maſters to be of the ſame conſpiracy, with the Phariſees and <hi>Herodians,</hi> namely at that Day when his Highneſſe ſhall ſtand before the Judgement ſeat of Jeſus Chriſt, without either his Clergy or his Lawyers to plead his Cauſe. We ſhall then underſtand what Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions they were which he or his Secretaries gave his Catch poles, when he imployed them, and what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference he had with them when they read our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Notes in his hearing; and all thoſe works of darkneſſe and ſecrecy ſhall be brought to light, and <hi>Our Lord Himſelfe</hi> ſhall ſecond our Teſtimony, <hi>That their Deeds were evill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, Other <hi>evill workes</hi> of the world, and the men of the world, which the Lord Jeſus did teſtifie againſt, was, <hi>Their devouring widdowes houſes, while for a pretence they made long prayers,</hi> Mat. 23.14. Surely this was a <hi>double evill worke,</hi> and therefore He tells them they ſhall receive <hi>greater Damnation.</hi> Not only widdowes Houſes have been devoured by the new Rulers, but whole Families, in preſſing and forcing, or elſe inticing men to the ends of the earth for Gold and Silver, thouſands having periſhed in the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize; but while theſe Families were devoured by
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118692:8"/>Sea and Land, what frequent faſtings and long pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were made at <hi>White-Hall:</hi> The Lord beholds this. Hypocriſie, and it will one day appear how abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable this project was in the ſight of God (as it doth in part already) not withſtanding all their long pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to colour it over, as a Deſigne againſt Antichriſt and his Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe <hi>evill works</hi> before Mentioned, the Lord declares againſt them, becauſe of their <hi>extortion and exceſſe,</hi> as it is in <hi>Matthew,</hi> becauſe of their <hi>rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and wickedneſſe,</hi> as it is in <hi>Luke,</hi> yea he ſpeaks of their <hi>Binding of heavy Burthens and grievous to be borne, and laying them on mens ſhoulders, but they will not move them with one of their fingers.</hi> For my part, I am verily perſwaded that the ſame <hi>evill workes</hi> are Done to the Innocent people by <hi>this preſent Sword power,</hi> and their <hi>cryes enter into the ears of the Lord of Hoasts,</hi> though they pity them not, who Doe thus oppreſſe them.</p>
            <p>Many more might be added, which in the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the true Diſciples of Chriſt, will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>evill workes,</hi> (but I muſt not inlarge a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face beyond its proportion) this therefore ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face for the ſecond Point, what kind of <hi>evill workes</hi> they were which Chriſt teſtified againſt, and how like unto them, the <hi>evill workes</hi> of this preſent Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Rulers will be found to be, when they are examined by the Righteous Judge of all the world.</p>
            <p>Now as for the Nature of the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> given by Chriſt concerning the <hi>evill works</hi> of that world or worldly Church which hated both him, his doctrine, and his followers (which is the third generall Head to be ſpoken to) it's plain, that it is no leſſe then a <hi>Divine Teſtimony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>If we receive the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> WITNES
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118692:8"/>of men, THE WITNES OF GOD is greater.</hi> Now <hi>This Witneſſe</hi> (or Teſtimony) whereof we are ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king from <hi>John</hi> 7.7. is not the witneſſe of a man, a mortall man, but the witneſſe of God, the witneſſe of one who is God and man, and ſo it is moſt Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. And how often Doth our Lord in his Miniſtry and Teſtimony, inculcate this upon his hearers, <hi>That he ſpake nothing of himſelf, but as the Father gave him Commandement?</hi> John 12.49, 50. And again, <hi>John</hi> 8.38. <hi>I ſpeak that which I have ſeen with my Father.</hi> So that when the Lord Jeſus teſtified, it was the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Teſtimony which could have been given to the truth.</p>
            <p>His Teſtimony was an <hi>unqueſtionable Teſtimony,</hi> a <hi>righteous Teſtimony, a witneſſe</hi> which will carry the cauſe againſt the whole world: for <hi>Let God be true, but every man a lyar, as it is written, that thou mighteſt be juſtified in thy ſayings.</hi> The ſayings of Chriſt from the father concerning <hi>this preſent evill world, and the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed works thereof,</hi> will be made good at the laſt day. Let no powers on earth think or hope to enervate his Teſtimony in the leaſt, by any <hi>pretences, excuſes,</hi> or <hi>distinctions</hi> whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Now as <hi>Christ Himſelfe</hi> was in the world, ſo ought thoſe who are <hi>Chriſts Miniſters and Witneſſes,</hi> to be in the world likewiſe. Thoſe whom he ſendeth were born and anointed to this end, <hi>viz.</hi> to bear witneſſe to the truth in his ſted, and on his behalf; and let the Princes of the world, and the people of the world aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure themſelves, The Lord never did, nor ever will, <hi>leave himſelfe without witneſſe.</hi> Some of his Servants ſhall be ſtirred up by his Spirit to plead the Cauſe of their Lord againſt his adverſaries; altho they know before hand, that through the hatred of the world,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118692:9"/>they ſhall be expoſed to a thouſand dangers, diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, deaths, for the truths ſake.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dragon,</hi> the <hi>beast,</hi> the <hi>ſcarlet Whore,</hi> the <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> the <hi>Kings of the earth,</hi> although by <hi>a complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of intereſts,</hi> they are <hi>deſperately ingaged and inraged</hi> againſt the <hi>Lamb and his followers,</hi> againſt the <hi>Lord and his witneſſes,</hi> nevertheleſſe the wrath of God hath been (and now is) revealed from heaven to their very faces againſt all their ungodlineſſe and unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, by thoſe witneſſes, which he hath raiſed up and furniſhed, with Heroick ſpirits to contend with the whole earth, and that wrath ſo revealed, by his Servants the Prophets, ſhall be executed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, for <hi>The Teſtimony of Jeſus is the Spirit of Prophecy,</hi> which the true Church is never deſtitute of alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>So that I am perſwaded (and I believe many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) that Matters are carried at this day, betwixt the Servants and Spirit of Chriſt, and the Servants and Spirit of Antichriſt, as they were carried in thoſe dayes betwixt the Spirit &amp; perſon of Chriſt, and the Spirit and perſons of the Prieſts and powers of the earth.</p>
            <p>It is not to be expected that his Highneſſes Court Chaplaines who are fed at his Table, ſhould lift up their heel againſt their Good Lord and Maſter, in te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying openly that <hi>his Counſells</hi> are <hi>evill,</hi> that <hi>his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument</hi> is an <hi>ugly Idol,</hi> and an <hi>Image of Jealouſie,</hi> that his <hi>Government is evill,</hi> that his <hi>workes</hi> in impriſoning the Servants of Chriſt without Juſt Cauſe are <hi>evil,</hi> that <hi>his Extortion</hi> and <hi>Rapine</hi> in Impoſing and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in all his Taxes by an Arbitrary power, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Law of God and the Land, <hi>is evill,</hi> that <hi>his devouring whole families</hi> in ſending thouſands to the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118692:9"/>ends of the earth (and multitudes againſt their wills) upon a baſe and beggerly Deſigne, that ſtinkes in the noſtrills of God, and good men, <hi>is evill and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable:</hi> And which of his City and Country Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen fed and Cloathed by his Tyrannicall executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Popes Cannon Law will declare againſt him for maintaining the Relicts and Remainders of Popery; and for his ſetting up New-Carnall ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Courts of Prelaticall Tryers or Comiſſioners to reigne over the Pariſh Miniſters in the Byſhops ſtead. Which of thoſe Inſlaved Preachers, Lecturers and Augmentation-Men, who come cap in hand to their Inferiors or equalls for their Approbation, and a box full of Orthodox Orders to preach in ſuch or ſuch a ſteeple Houſe, and to receive the ancient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and perquiſites of the pariſh for their paines, dare to turn head upon <hi>their Eccleſiaſticall Lords,</hi> and joyn with Chriſt and his ſpirit, to teſtify againſt theſe <hi>New invented Babyloniſh Abominations?</hi> Alas poor wretches they have no heart, no ſpirit for the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of Chriſt, they are aſhamed of the teſtimony of our Lord and of us his priſoners, who by the moſt powerfull Illapſes and influences of his ſpirit, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled and Conſtrayned to bid Defyance to the <hi>ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let coloured Beaſt,</hi> and to <hi>all his 7 heads of Blaſphemy,</hi> and to all <hi>his ten homs of perſecution,</hi> to all the <hi>Kings of the earth which commit fornication with the mother of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, and with all her danghters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, becauſe theſe Men, thus lamentably yoaked by <hi>their new Lords Spirituall and Temporall,</hi> dare not particularly and couragiouſly, in the power of the Spirit, bear their Teſtimony for Chriſt, againſt the world, or world like Church, <hi>that their deeds are evill;</hi> therefore the Lord will raiſe up others to ſupply this defect. And be it known to all the Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118692:10"/>which <hi>oppreſſe and perſecute the Children of the free woman,</hi> that the Lord will furniſh himſelf with a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Number of faithfull Servants, who ſhall, in his ſtrength, maintain that Conflict and Combate which is needful, <hi>till the great of the Battel of the Almighty God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As Chriſt told the Chief Prieſts and Scribes, who were diſpleaſed that the Children cryed <hi>Hoſanna to the Son of David: If theſe ſhould hold their peace, the ſtones would immediately cry out,</hi> ſo I ſay, in words of truth and ſoberneſſe, ſeeing the Chief Preachers, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and Teachers, <hi>are dumb,</hi> and connive at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Apoſtacy, Hypocriſie, Oppreſſion, Tyrannicall Government, and going back to <hi>AEgypt,</hi> the Lord is as it were compelled to furniſh himſelf, from among the private Chriſtians, and the weakeſt and meaneſt of the Brethren, to bear a Teſtimony againſt this wicked Generation of Backſliders, and if they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhould hold their peace altogether, the ſtones of the ſtreetes, and the very bruite Creatures would immediatly cry out for the Lord will not altogether and utterly leave himſelfe without witnes. This In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Treatiſe, was not Compoſed by any of the Univerſity-ſcarlet Doctors, nor by any Batchelour of Divinity, or Maſter of Arts and ſciences, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded their <hi>Acadenicall <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> will teach them to <hi>practice complyance,</hi> and to <hi>ſing Placebo.</hi> But ſurely this is ſome Honeſt Sool, who obſerving the Common Clergy to be as mute as Fiſhes, when <hi>they ſhould have cryed aloud, and have lifted up their voyces as a Trumpet,</hi> to ſhew the Apoſtatized Chriſtians their tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the Hypocrites their ſins, hath ſo far layed their Abominations to heart, that he cannot for bear to ſpeak a word for God againſt ſuch an adulterous Generation, and to encourage <hi>that little Remnant which ſpeak often one to another, and think upon Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah's

The number of thoſe hath he augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of late, and proſpered their Teſtimony to a great encreaſe of light, and ſtill the Lord holds them in his right hand, and makes them like the Pen of a ready Writer, bearing a ſwift Teſtimony againſt the moſt refined abominations of Profeſſors, declaring the mind of the Lord in divers dark ſayings of Scripture, bringing that light out of obſcurity, that many ages past have never ſeen;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.12.</note> ſhowing plainly how the Prophets of old, did Miniſter to the Saints and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors in the laſt dayes. Behold how theſe at this day are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118692:11"/>(as from the dead) <hi>to witneſſe for God and Chriſt</hi> against a ſinfull and adulterous Generation. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth me to behold how the Lord doth ſpirit inſtruments, and inſtruct them to promote their Teſtimony, by expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſitly applying, their words for Reproof, and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in Righteouſneſſe, as once he did <hi>Ezra,</hi> and others with him, to hold forth the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when that work, which typed forth much of this now in doing, was upon the wheele.</p>
            <p>But as the Lords Witneſſes of old, were the main object of the hatred of thoſe whom they witneſſed againſt, as <hi>Amos, Jeremy,</hi> and others, who were threatned, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, and reproached: even ſo, are the Children of the Prophets, thoſe who (through their word) are brought forth to witneſſe againſt evill doers, now, hated and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed by the men of this Generation. I know men are ready to ſay with the Phariſees, <hi>Mat. 23.30, 31, 32. If we had lived in the dayes of our fathers, we would not have perſecuted the Prophets,</hi> whileſt in the mean time they ſeek to ſuppreſſe thoſe, who in <hi>the ſame Spirit of faith,</hi> doe with their words explained, bear witneſs againſt ſuch, yea, the ſelf ſame evills by other perſons committed now.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But ſome may Object, ſaying, This is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and work of extraordinary Prophets only, to bear a Teſtimony againſt the evills of the Times, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Miniſters have little to doe, ordinary Saints much leſſe, with ſuch matters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Prophecies of old, and the Teſtimonies of the Prophets, are gathered up into the Propheſie and Teſtimony of Chriſt, the Great <hi>Prophet</hi> of the New Teſtament, <hi>the faithfull witneſſe</hi> and by him (having received of the Father <hi>The Promiſe of the Spirit,</hi> in the fullneſſe of it) committed to his Seed, even the faithfull, (believers as believers being made to partake abundantly of the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118692:12"/>which was not given at leaſt ſo generally, and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, untill Jeſus was exalted, <hi>John 7. 38, 39.</hi>) by them to be declared, and held forth from Generation to Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, each word in its ſeaſon, according to their meaſure of Grace, and of the gift of Chriſt, as theſe Scriptures here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, with many more doe ſufficiently prove, <hi>Rev. 1.4, 5, 11. Rev. 12.10, 11, 17. Iſa. 59.21. Pſa. 145.4. Iſa. 43.3, 5, 8. Iſa. 8.16. 2 Tim. 2.2.</hi> And as it is the concernment of Saints in generall, qualified for the worke, to witneſſe for Chriſt against Antichriſt, ſo is it in a ſpeciall manner the worke of Goſpel Miniſters orderly called to that Office, to bear their Teſtimony againſt all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Abominations.</p>
            <p>And if theſe things be ſo, may we not conclude, that men ought to take heed that they be not found deſpiſers, when God comes forth by the words of his Servants (though Babes and Sucklings) with stammering tongues and pens,<note place="margin">Pſal. 8.2.</note> to witneſſe againſt the evills of the times.</p>
            <p>O <hi>Yee</hi> that are called by the name of Saints, <hi>Is it a time for you to dwell</hi> at eaſe <hi>in your cieled houſes?</hi> Is it not high time to awake and to conſider your wayes? to enquire into, to lay to heart, to ſigh and cry for, all the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of ſuch as profeſſe to be the Lords people, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the grace and praiſe-worthy name of God is reproached at home and abroad? Oh how gloriouſly is this duty rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? and how ſeverely are profeſſors, even the ancient of them, puniſhed for the neglect hereof? <hi>Ezek. 9.4, 5, 6, 7.</hi> If love to God and Chriſt doth not conſtrain, yet let the juſt judgements of God breaking forth upon <hi>a</hi> profeſſing yet ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſecure people, provoke you hereunto.</p>
            <p>In this weighty work the enſuing Treatiſe will afford thee no ſmall help, for by it (if the preſence of the Lord accompany the reading) thou mayeſt dig through a wall as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was bid to doe, <hi>Ezek. 8.7, 8, 12.</hi> and mayeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118692:12"/>with him an open door, whereat entring in, thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est ſee greater abominations, then probably thou hast hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto obſerved, vayled over with ſpetious pretences, and a large profeſſion. Herein is the wiſedome of God to be ſeen, and juſtified, in bringing his truths to light in their proper time, whileſt men are working in the darke,<note place="margin">Iſa. 29.15.</note> ſaying <hi>Who ſeeth us?</hi> How hath the Lord lighted Candles wherewith to ſearch <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> viſiting the men that are ſetling,<note place="margin">Zeph. 1.12.</note> or willing to ſetle on their Lees.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> This worke ſerves not only to preſent unto thee (as it were in a Glaſſe) the face of the Times, but thine own face, uſe it as a Touchſtone to try thy heart, whether it be right for the Lord, and for his work. Behold how the Lord comes, and <hi>ſits as a Refiner,</hi> in and through thoſe diſcoveries of ſoule-ſearehing truths,<note place="margin">Jer. 23.29.</note> which he brings to light daily.</p>
            <p>His word that goeth forth out of the mouth of his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, is like fire refining the precious Sons of <hi>Sion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 11.5.</note> who are compared to Gold, but conſuming,<note place="margin">Lam. 4.2.</note> or threatning to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the wicked, who are like stubble. The Sword that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth out of the mouth of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Rev. 2.12.</note> is <hi>ſharp</hi> and <hi>two-edg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> if it doe not convert from ſin, it will condemne for continuing in ſin. Such as are diſobedient to his word, are inexcuſable, fitted for ruine, as ſtubble fully dry. And have not ſome cauſe to fear, that, if after many reproofs,<note place="margin">Exod. 23.28.</note> they goe on hardning their necks, their fall will be ſudden,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.7, 8.</note> and their ſad condition remedileſſe? <hi>Prov. 29. 1. Iſa. 30.10, 11, 12, 13.</hi> Yea, and then ſhall the Lords people who have teſtified againſt them, rebuking in the Gate,<note place="margin">Jer. 7.16.</note> and exhorting to repentance, keep ſilence in that day,<note place="margin">Jer. 11.14.</note> ceaſing to plead with them, or with God for them,<note place="margin">Amos 5.13.</note> thereby juſtifying the hand of God in bringing his judgements on them. And whoſo is wiſe let him obſerve, That when thoſe backsliders ſpoken of, <hi>Iſa. 29.20, 21.</hi> proceeded to that degree of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impiety,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118692:13"/>to <hi>watch for iniquity,</hi> to <hi>make a man an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendor for a word, and lay a ſnare for him that repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Gate,</hi> by ſuch acts as theſe, they perfected their iniquity, and filled up the meaſure thereof.</p>
            <p>The following Diſcourſe ſets forth in a Type, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring together many remarkable words in the Prophecy of <hi>Malachy</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah, A moſt refined Apoſtacy</hi> of a profeſſing people, after a Reformation begun. Their words, though firſt ſpoken to others, are declared to light on us the Saints, and Profeſſors in this Generation, who having greatly ſinned,<note place="margin">num. 32.23.</note> may juſtly ſay, <hi>Our ſins have found us out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as relating to this Apoſtacy, or Backsliding, with the cauſe, and cure thereof, I ſhall offer theſe things to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>As this backsliding is either totall and finall, in thoſe who periſh, or partiall, in the Saints, ſo alſo is the cauſe thereof two-fold.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Hypocrites, who fall away in time of temptation, have no root in themſelves, <hi>Luke 8.13.</hi> They are not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Divine nature, neither are they regenerate; wherefore ſuch Profeſſors notwithſtanding for a time they may appear with clean outſides, are fitly compared by the Spirit of the Lord to the Sow, which being waſhed, turns again to her wallowing in the mire, <hi>2 Pet. 2.22.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Backsliding which is not totall, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily ſprings from Saints forgetfullneſſe of Gods <hi>great love</hi> in Chriſt revealed to them, and his <hi>wonderful works</hi> done in them, and for them; as alſo the love of their eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalls, their firſt love to God, their relations, vowes, and engagements to him.</p>
            <p>Of this Backsliding both of ſinners and Saints, and the judgements thereunto belonging, doe theſe Prophets treat. The Saints themſelves, Gods Children, and his Jewells ſhall
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118692:13"/>not eſcape a trying refining day, which will be terrible to them; yea, and as they are or may be found in unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, earthly, ſenſuall forms of Spirit, conſulting with fleſh and blood, unſufferable. <hi>Who ſhall ſtand when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth?</hi> Mal. <hi>3.2, 3.</hi> His preſence to the carrying on of this work of reforning will be to ſome (who may be judged good men) no leſſe grievous, but rather more then fire is the fleſh of a man.</p>
            <p>As for Hypocrites and Sinners in <hi>Syon,</hi> their dreadfull doom, and juſt ſentence that goeth forth out of the mouth of thoſe two Witneſſes, is, that they ſhall be conſumed, <hi>Iſa. 1.28. Mal. 4.1.</hi> The fiery <hi>day</hi> ſhall <hi>burn them up,</hi> that <hi>it ſhall leave them neither root nor branch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to that word of God to <hi>Jer. 15.19. If thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou ſhalt be as my mouth.</hi> This Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> ſpeaking as the mouth of God, puts a difference (as alſo doth the Prophets and Apoſtles generally) between the two Seeds, <hi>The Seed of the Woman, and of the Serpent,</hi> between whom God did by his own mouth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> firſt put the difference, <hi>Gen. 3.15.</hi> To all which agrees that clear diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Son of the bond woman, and of the free, Gal. 4.22, 23:</hi> which things (ſaith the Apostle, <hi>v. 24.</hi>) are an Allegory, for theſe are the two Covenants, <hi>viz. The one of Works, the other of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two grand Characters whereby the two Seeds are here diſtinguiſhed, are
<list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>1 A true filiall fear of God.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>2 A ſincere love and reſpect unto the name of God above all things.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe two choyce effects of a lively faith, are ſuch things as Hypocrites are ſtrangers to, ſuch ſingular things as doe infallibly accompany ſalvation. In theſe things the carnal ſeed under the Law, and the formall Profeſſor under the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:118692:14"/>Goſpel, come ſhort of the Iſraelite in deed, and being weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ballance of the Sanctuary, are found wanting. And although ſuch may be in a Pallace with King <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar,</hi> if they look narrowly into this Prophecy of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachy,</hi> as here explained and preſented to their view, it may be with them (if they be not miſerably hardned) no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than with him, when beholding the writing on the wall, <hi>his countenance was changed,</hi> and <hi>his thoughts trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him,</hi> ſo that the <hi>joynts of his loines were looſed, and his knees ſmote one againſt another,</hi> Dan. <hi>5.6.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the former of theſe, <hi>viz. A filiall fear of God,</hi> upon the account of their lack of this one thing, the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> reproves the people, ſaying, <hi>Chap. 1.6. If I be a Father, where is mine honour? And if I be a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, where is my fear, ſaith the Lord of Hoſte?</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary, he commends his beloved Remnant for their <hi>fear of him,</hi> Chap. <hi>3.16.</hi> and of his <hi>Name,</hi> Chap. <hi>4.2.</hi> Yea, Chriſt himſelf the everlaſting father of that choſen Generation, is extoll'd, and found worthy to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the greateſt of Gods work, on the account of this bleſſed qualification, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>fear</hi> of God, <hi>Chap. 2.5. My Covenant was with him, of life and peace, and I gave them to him</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things well weighed, may through the bleſſing of the Lord, give ſome check to that unſeemly lightneſs which often appears in the ſhameleſſe foreheads of many noted Profeſſors. Oh! where will ſuch appear, if they repent not, ſeeing God hath not entred them on his Book of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, which is written for thoſe only who <hi>fear the Lord,</hi> Chap. <hi>3.16. and tremble at his word?</hi> How ſhall they eſcape that <hi>dreadfull day</hi> mentioned, <hi>Chap. 4.1.</hi> Seeing then our God is a conſuming fire, let us then take
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118692:14"/>hold of his grace in Chriſt Jeſus, whereby to ſerve him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably, with reverence and godly fear. He who is riſen up to ſhake hereby the Earth, and alſo the Heavens, will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ere long ſhake off and caſt out (as it were out of his lap) a Generation of light and looſe Profeſſors; againſt whom, thoſe who are of a low and legal ſpirit and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, falling ſhort by many degrees of their profeſſed light in the Goſpel, are riſen up, and ſhall riſe in Judgement to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them, for their intollerable pride and ſenſuallity.</p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>If any ſhall now enquire, what is this fear of the Lord here ſpoken of?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> It is a precious effect of the Spirit of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Iſa. 11.23.</note> in the heart of a believer,<note place="margin">Jer. 32.40.</note> whereby (through the diſcovery of the glory of God in his word,<note place="margin">Pſal 86.11.</note> and works by Christ;<note place="margin">Rom. 3.18.</note> and in conſideration of the vaſt diſproportion that is between God and the Creature) he is made to think highly of God in all his Attributes,<note place="margin">Exod. 33.18. &amp; 34.4, 5, 6, 7.</note> and to have reſpect unto all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.<note place="margin">Hoſea 3.5.</note> Thus referring the Reader to the ſearch of Scriptures,<note place="margin">Pſa. 8.3, 4.</note> whether the thing be ſo,<note place="margin">Pſa. 111.7, 8, 9, 10.</note> and to the examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his own heart,<note place="margin">Jer. 10.6, 7, 10, 12.</note> whether this good thing be found in him,<note place="margin">Iſa. 40.15, 16, 17.</note> I ſhall haſten to the ſecond qualification before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Eccl. 12.13.</note> The ſecond Character whereby the faithfull people of God are diſtinguiſhed from thoſe Formaliſts, is, <hi>Their true, and tender reſpect unto the name and glory of God; preferring it above all their private concernments.</hi> Of this bleſſed frame that people fell ſhort, who are upon this account reproved by the Prophet: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is their Hypocriſie diſcovered, that notwithſtanding all their profeſſion, and performance of duties in aſſembling and bringing Offerings, yet, the Lord declares againſt them, becauſe they were men of mercenary ſelf-ſeeking ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. <hi>Which of you,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>would kindle a fire on might Altar for nought?</hi> Ch. <hi>1.10.</hi> Theſe were more
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118692:15"/>like the Off ſpring of <hi>Hagar,</hi> than <hi>Sarah,</hi> unfit for Gods worke, which was to exalt his name among the Heathen: wherefore he layes them by, ſaying, <hi>I have no pleaſure in you;</hi> neither would he <hi>accept an Offering</hi> at their hands, as you may ſee in the ſame Verſe, and in <hi>Chap. 2.3.</hi> of this ſin, who are ſo deeply guilty as the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> whom the Prophet chargeth with <hi>deſpiſing</hi> Gods great Name? <hi>Chap. 1.16.</hi> yet are they fartheſt off from conviction. They put the Prophet (or rather the Lord) to it, to prove the charge, with <hi>A WHEREIN, Wherein</hi> (ſay they) <hi>have we deſpiſed thy Name?</hi> And thus they diſpute with God and his Meſſenger: but we find little or no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, or conviction of any evill charged on them, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a charging God with injuſtice, or unrighteouſneſſe, in not rewarding their ſervices, <hi>Chap. 3.14.</hi> ſpeaking ſtout words against him, ſaying, <hi>It is vain to ſerve the Lord.</hi> Could not theſe boaſt of a large and long profeſſion, as doe many now, of their <hi>keeping Gods Ordinances, walking mournfully before the Lord?</hi> &amp;c. Theſe obſerving ſolemne dayes of Faſting and Prayer, as thoſe whom the Prophet layes open and reproves, <hi>Iſa. 1. &amp; 58.2, 3.</hi> But in all theſe things mark what they had in their eye, their own profit; <hi>What profit is it?</hi> ſay they.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>right Seed,</hi> their care is exerciſed about <hi>their fathers name;</hi> regarding it ſo much the more, by how much others ſlighed it, and as being provoked by the backſliding of many, to an holy jealouſie for God, whilest others are looking after their Olive yards, and Vineyards, their purchaſes and large pay; at beſt, their preſent ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enjoyments. Theſe are content to ſerve God (though as to an eye of ſenſe) for nought, and without profit; if God hide his face, they will give him glory by looking to him, and waiting for him. They meet together in a dark day, and ſpeak often one to another of the things that concern
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118692:15"/>their fathers <hi>Name,</hi> that being with moſt weight on their hearts: We read of nothing ſave that, nothing like to that upon their hearts, they minded it more then their Trades, Farms, Wife and Children, Lands and Lives; theſe are the right ſeed whom God owns for his in trying dayes, <hi>Mal. 3.16, 17.</hi> and whom he delights to uſe, having bent their hearts for him, and for his deſign, to make his name great in all the earth; to theſe he promiſeth the <hi>ſhinings of the Son of Righteouſneſſe, with healing in his wings,</hi> Mal. <hi>4.2, 3.</hi> and that they <hi>ſhall goe forth, and grow up as Calves of the ſtall, and tread down the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who ſhall be as aſhes under the ſoales of their feet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words and actions of that choſen Remnant thus qualified (howſoever ſlighted by the proud) are noted in Gods <hi>BOOK OF REMEMBRANCE,</hi> where their words who in a light ſelf-ſeeking ſpirit made uſe of his great name, have no place. How apparent is the difference in this reſpect, betwixt many Profeſſors, and Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers? ſome chiefly minding that work, and thoſe duties, wherein they apprehend their preſent comfort and eternall ſalvation most neerly concerned, little regarding thoſe Ordinances which more eſpecially reſpect the honour of God, as to reprove ſin, and to reject or excommunicate offendors, as juſt occaſion is offered; an Ordinance, by the due pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice whereof, the name of God his truth and people are cleared, and preſerved from the blame of the miſcarriages of ſcandalous offendors: how heartleſſe are Profeſſors and Ministers (at leaſt ſo accounted) to this work? Did God lay them by of old, who deſpiſed his name, and will not God lay theſe by as Veſſels wherein he takes no pleaſure, if they repent not, and that ſpeedily? in as much as he is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king haſt to his great work, <hi>viz. To exalt his great name, not in one corner of the earth, but in all the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:118692:16"/>corners thereof;</hi> Amen, Hallowed be thy Name, and Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujah.</p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>But who ſhall follow the Lord in this great work?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> They only who are called choſen and faithfull, whom he hath formed for his praiſe, having redeemed them from the earth. Theſe follow him whitherſoever he goeth, not looking and tarrying for man, till ſuch and ſuch a man goe before them: It is enough to them to ſee clearly, that the Lamb goes before them, for they are his followers, and will follow no other, but in the way of following him.</p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>But whence is it, or how comes it to paſſe, that ſo many profeſſed followers of the Lamb, doe turn back, yea, and turn againſt him at this time?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Surely with many (if not with all) ſuch Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, the cauſe is, their not being eſtabliſhed with the grace of God, becauſe they were not ſtedfaſt in believing Gods free Promiſes in Chriſt for the Kingdome, and all things elſe to be added to them in ſeeking that firſt. Their hearts being not right in the matter of Regeneration, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have they failed in the work of their Generation; and being found Enemies to a thorow work within, are found ſuch to a thorow work of righteouſneſſe without, and abroad in the Nation: But did ſuch at firſt run well? Oh then, ſeeing ſo many have begun to build, and have not been able to finiſh; let thoſe who would follow Christ in the Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or their Generation work, ſit down firſt, and (with ſerious ſpirits) count the coſt. Take that word of Chriſt for your help, <hi>Luke 14.26.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:118692:16"/>who chuſe rather to looſe their <hi>ALL</hi> in this world, than to doe any thing contrary to the mind of God contained therein. As for others, the Lord counts them unworthy; and if they be enlightned, they cannot but judge themſelves unworthy of ſo great a truſt.</p>
            <p>But why doe I detain the Reader thus long from that diſcourſe, which may afford more profit and delight? The work is before thee, goe on to it in the fear of the Lord; onely this I ſhall ſay further, <hi>viz.</hi> That I doubt not but men who will reject a good work (as the manner of ſome is) for ſome ſmall (and it may be meerly ſuppoſed) Errour, may find whereat to be ſtumbled in reading this Book; and ſo this, as many other worthy works, be rendred uſeleſſe, and an offence to them; whileſt honeſt hearts (who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the love of truth, cannot eaſily be prejudic'd againſt it, <hi>Pſal. 119.165.</hi>) are like to reap precious benefit here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. And here let it be noted alſo, That God is not a little jealous for the glory of his great Name, in the work he hath begun. Though he will uſe man in his work, yet ſo, as that his Imperfection ſhall appear, that we may ceaſe from man, and from glorying in men, our ſelves, or others; and that we may give all the glory to him, whoſe due it is. Amen; <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> and <hi>wiſedome,</hi> and <hi>thankſgiving,</hi> and <hi>honour,</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>might, be given unto our God for ever.</hi> Having thus far enlarged, as being engaged to bear my Teſtimony in love to thoſe truths con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the enſuing worke, I commend it to the Lord for his bleſſing, adding this onely, that I am</p>

            </p>
            <p>But in a more particular way.</p>
            <p>After many viſſitudes and changes, fals and riſings, backſlid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and reformations wrought in this Common-wealth (which alſo are not without their Tipical ſignificancies,) when thoſe two admirable &amp; excellent Tipes, <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> had run their race, this people of one Nation <hi>became two,</hi> which ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pically is very ſignificant to us: For as thoſe 10 <hi>Tribes</hi> who made the fraction, preſently turned aſide from their God, and through their backſlidings and apoſtacies after many warnings from Heaven, brought a deſtroying enemy upon them, that their place and name was taken quite away; they were a <hi>Tipe</hi> of thoſe <hi>ten parts</hi> (if <hi>I</hi> may ſo expreſs it) <hi>of the profeſſing Goſpel-Church,</hi> who through their backſlidings and apoſtacies<note n="a" place="margin">2 Theſ: 2.3.</note> falling away, made way for the man of Sin, the Babyloniſh power to exalt it ſelf over them to their ruine.</p>
            <p>And as the Lord for his ſervant <hi>Davids</hi> ſake, and for <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lems</hi> ſake, promiſed to <hi>preſerve one Tribe,</hi> that <hi>David</hi> might have<note n="b" place="margin">1 King. 11.36</note> a light before the Lord in <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> notwithſtanding their backſlidings and apoſtacies, yet upon the pure account of his Covenant with <hi>David,</hi> the Lord preſerves this one Tribe (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his promiſe) til <hi>Shiloh</hi> came: this Tribe was a <hi>Tipe</hi> of that ſmal <hi>part of the profeſſing Goſpel-Church,</hi> which the Lord will preſerve for <hi>David</hi> his Sons ſake, and for <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> his true Churches ſake, that the ſeed of the Woman may not be quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, nor our Lord Jeſus the Son of God left without his Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in the world, notwithſtanding all the deviations, backſlid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and apoſtacies of Kings, Rulers, and people, yet there is a cluſter in the midſt of it, that hath ſuch a bleſſing in it, that it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118692:18"/>ſhal be preſerved and continue, til he comes the ſecond time, whoſe right it is to Reign.</p>
            <p>But for the iniquities, backſlidings, and Apoſtacies of this one Tribe, the Lord <hi>delivers them</hi> for a ſeaſon into the hand of the King of <hi>Babilon;</hi> and after a certain term of time, by a <hi>Cyrus</hi> he opens away for their <hi>coming out</hi> of <hi>Babilon,</hi> and return to their own Land to Worſhip the Lord God of their Fathers at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> in the true Church; now they <hi>apoſtatiſing</hi> after this ſuper-abundant grace and favour, ſtopping their ears againſt the Lords Meſſengers, he withdraws, God leaves them to themſelves, their Prophets ceaſe, the Lord troubles them with no more of his Meſſengers, only there is a company of honeſt hearts that fear the Lord, ſpeaking often one to another about theſe things, but their language is ſuch, as is neither underſtood, nor hearkned to by that Generation, indeed it's ſaid <hi>the Lord hearkned and heard,</hi> but not a man minds it as we read of: in this particular alſo is this <hi>one Tribe a Tipe;</hi> and its of no ſmal concernment to us at this day.</p>
            <p>In this time of apoſtacy it was, that our Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his heavenly Meſſage: before I can enter into the miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of thoſe words, the opening of which is my chief deſigne; there lies a neceſſity upon me ſomewhat to minde the Prophecy in general.</p>
            <p>In this Prophecie there are three ſpecial, remarkable times to be minded.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 A day or time of <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> wherein the Lord ſpake theſe words by the mouth of his ſervant <hi>Malachy.</hi>

               <item>2 A day or time of <hi>purging and purifying</hi> Syon in the 3 <hi>Chap.</hi>

            <p>That this day of <hi>Judgement</hi> that ſhal burn like an Oven, is one and the ſame with the time of <hi>Dauiels</hi> ſtones ſmiting the great Image, is clear to me upon this double ground.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe I find the ſame work done in this day, the ſtone doth in that.</p>

            </q>
            <p n="2">2 Becauſe I find the ſame growth and proſperity, the ſame bleſſing following the performance of the work in both pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>

            <p>That the Lord might prepare and fit his people for the great work of this terrible day, he wil <hi>purge and purifie</hi> them: which is the work of the 2d. day or time mentioned in the Third <hi>Ch.</hi> of this Prophecie. To prevent ſome objections which perhaps might be thrown in the way of that further uſe I muſt make of this Prophecie in its due place, <hi>I</hi> deſire you to take notice of two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this Prophecie hath <hi>ſpecial relation to the Gentiles</hi> in this Goſpel-day, which is apparent by that partial fulfilling of this Prophecy, our Lord himſelf attributes to the beginning of the Goſpel-day, even his dayes in the fleſh, as wil be evident it you compare with this Prophecie, <hi>Math.</hi> 11.10. <hi>Mark</hi> 1.2, 3. <hi>Luke</hi> 7.27. and <hi>Mat:</hi> 3.11, 12.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That it hath not <hi>yet been fulfilled, either to Jew or Gentile:</hi> this purifying here treated of, is a Reformation wrought after an Apoſtacy, for in the day of the moſt wicked and loathed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy ever <hi>Iſrael</hi> was guilty of, the Prophet ſpeaks of it as that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118692:19"/>which is <hi>to come:</hi> and ſueh a reformation it is, as is a reducing the people to their firſt and priſtine glory and beauty they had in the day of their Eſpouſals, as the 4th. verſe intimates to us, <hi>Then ſhall the offerings of Judah and Jeruſalem be pleaſant unto the Lord, as in the dayes of old, as in antient years,</hi> (as the margent of ſome Bibles hath it.) the excellent glory and Heavenlineſs of this beauty was ſuch, as the Lord ſeems to glory in it, <hi>Jer:</hi> 2. 2, 3 <hi>I remember thee, the kindneſs of thy youth, the love of thine eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals; Iſrael was holineſs unto the Lord:</hi> it's deſeribed at large <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek:</hi> 16. from the 8th: to the 15th. verſe, and our Lord himſelf ſeems to hint at ſuch a Reformation, in that ſpeech of his, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.8. <hi>But from the beginning it was not ſo:</hi> intimating to us, that things ought to be reduced to their firſt inſlit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tion, their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtate: it is that which the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> muſt return to, otherwiſe ſhe muſt bear her puniſhment, <hi>Rev:</hi> 2.4, 5. This hath not yet been fulfilled to the <hi>Jews;</hi> for at our Lord firſt coming they were ſo far from being reduced by him to their former love, reformed to their firſt glory, as that they were <hi>caſt away, Rom:</hi> 11.15. and the day of the eſpouſals of the G miles came: and ſince that diſmal time to them, have they not been as a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple driven out from the preſence of the Lord? Neither have the <hi>Gentiles</hi> poſſeſt the fulneſs thereof; for can any man ſhew us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time or ſeaſon wherein any part of the profeſſing Goſpel-Church hath (after any of her backſlidings and apoſtacies) been adorned with the glory of her marriage-day, the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of her firſt love in the dayes of her youth, that the Lord could ſay unto her, <hi>Thy offerings are pleaſant unto me, as in the dayes of old, as in antient years?</hi> but ſo much it is, the Lord hath ſaid in this Prophecy he wil do for his choſen, and this glory it is the Lord wil clothe his <hi>Zion</hi> with in due time.</p>
            <p>We are now returned to the firſt day or time mentioned, which is, <hi>a day of great Apoſtacy:</hi> and by this time I hope I have gained ſome ground to make good with demonſtration to the underſtandings of men, the truth and certainty of the following diſcourſe. This <hi>day of Apostacy</hi> after the building of the ſecond Temple (that time of Reformation) being the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſt ſtate and condition of that one Tribe, as a Nation, and that wherein our Lord Jeſus came and found them to their coſt and ſorrow; It was a Tipe of the ſtate and condition of ſome part of the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Goſpel-Church, at that time wherein our Lord ſhal viſit it,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118692:20"/>with<note n="c" place="margin">Iſai. 4.4.</note> the ſpirit oſ Judgement, and the ſpirit of burning. That we may be able by ſcripture light, to know to whom this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy relates in a more ſpecial manner than to others; and that the door of our hearts might be opened (if poſſible) to receive the following truth: let us conſider,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The <hi>Time</hi> of this apoſtacy.</item>
               <item>2. The <hi>Quality</hi> of this apoſtacy.</item>
               <item>3. The <hi>People</hi> thus apoſtatiſing.</item>
            </list>
            <p>For the <hi>Time</hi> it ſelf, we have three Characters of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is <hi>after their coming out of Babilon</hi> (as is acknowledged on all hands, that <hi>Malachy</hi> was the laſt of the Prophets, and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied after <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zachary</hi>'s time, who Prophecied at the time of their return from <hi>Babilon</hi>) after the Lord had delivered them out of the hands of the Babilonians their enemies, and put them into a capacity to ſerve him in his own appointments, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his wil, they turn their backs upon their God, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatiſe from the Truth.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Its that time of Apoſtacy in Zyon, <hi>which the Lord will take to viſit his people in, with a ſpirt of Judgement, and a ſpirit of burning;</hi> by a fiery refining diſpenſation, making up his Jewels after the manner of purifying gold and ſilver: the Lord doth not ſuffer their enemies to carry them back into Babilon (he takes not that former courſe with them) but he takes them into his own hand to make them a fit and a ſuitable inſtrument to do that great, wonderful, and ſtrange work he hath to do in and upon the world: that this is ſuch a time, my thinks there needs no other proof then what the Prophet ſaith in the 5th: verſe of this 3d: Chapter, <hi>And I will come near to you to Judgement, and I will be a ſwift witneſs againſt you that fear not me ſaith the Lord of hosts;</hi> you, Who? why, thoſe to whom the Prophet had ſpoken before: it ſignifies thus much, in that day wherein <hi>I</hi> ſhal thus purge and purifie the ſons of <hi>Levi</hi> (my choſen) that they become beautiful and glorious, pleaſant unto me, <hi>I</hi> wil be a ſwift witneſs againſt you, and judge you that have thus without any fear of me play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Apoſtates, turned aſide and gone backward: the day of <hi>Sions</hi> purifying, is the day of the Lords judging theſe leaders of apoſtacy; therefore theſe Times are contemporary, ſo joyned to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether, as none can put them aſunder.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Its that time of apoſtacy <hi>immediatly preceding the stones ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great Image;</hi> that day wherein the Lord wil burn up the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118692:20"/>wicked, leaving them neither root nor branch: when the Lord by turning his hand upon his people, at the concluding time of this apoſtacy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath (refining them) made up his Jewels, fitted and qualified them, they fall to the work of the burning hot day mentioned in the 4th. Chapt. which hath been proved to be all one with that day of breaking <hi>Daniels</hi> great Image; there is no interval of Time between theſe two diſpenſation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the <hi>Quality</hi> of this Apoſtacy: its <hi>a refined hypocritical apoſtacy:</hi> Theſe men wil ſeem religious, although indeed their hearts are moſt irreligious,<note n="d" place="margin">Mal: 1.13</note>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>They are ſo heartily and throughly ſenſible of the ſufferings of the name and honour of their God, that their care for that ſwalloweth up all other cares:</hi> they minde not ſo much their own ſufferings under the oppreſſions of theſe workers of wickedneſs, as the ſufferings of the name and intereſt of their dear Lord, under that diſhonour and ſhame theſe wicked (tho refined) hypocrites throw upon it; their careful thoughts are ſolely taken up about the concernments of the name of their God; <hi>They thought upon his name:</hi> yet notwithſtanding theſe excellencies, they are not per-ſect.

(though poſſibly that may be more remotely in their thoughts too) but all their cares are diſſolved into a godly and holy carefulneſs, for the name and honour of their dear Lord: <hi>they thought upon his name,</hi> how that was diſhonoured; the Lord had gotten himſelf a great name, by delivering his people out of <hi>Babilon,</hi> rearing up the glorious ſtructure of his Temple, and building up the ruined wals of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſetting up his true Worſhip again there, in deſpight of all thoſe great oppoſitions of his enemies round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; and theſe backſliders diſpiſe and diſhonour this great name of the Lord of hoſts, doing what in them lies to bury it in Oblivion; now theſe lovers of the Name of God, think on this, are very ſolicitous what they ſhould do at this juncture of time to wipe off that diſhonour is caſt upon this great and glorious name in the view of the whole world; O ſay they, what ſhall we do for the name of our God? wherewith ſhall we honour it? what courſe ſhal we take to exalt and magnifie it in the eyes of the world, before whom it hath been thus diſhinored? here's the Center of all their thoughts and conſultations, <hi>They thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Name.</hi>

            <p n="1">1 From the phraiſe, THAT DAY, <hi>in that day when I make up my jewels:</hi> when the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks of a day or time to come, that he had not ſpoken of before, he cals it <hi>the day,</hi> as here in the fourth Chapter. <hi>Behold the day cometh that ſhal burn as an Oven, &amp;c.</hi> but when the Holy Ghoſt expreſſeth a day or time by <hi>that day,</hi> he points at the time treated of immediatly before, as in the Third and Fourth Chapter of <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> and indeed throughout the whole ſcripture <hi>I</hi> find it is the uſual manner of the Holy Ghoſt ſo to do: and this <hi>Refining-day</hi> being the time treated of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly before, we cannot rationally conceive any other day is pointed at by <hi>that day.</hi>

            <p n="2">2 From that other phraiſe, <hi>When I</hi> MAKE UP my <hi>Jewels;</hi> what more genuine and natural interpretation can be given, than, that theſe <hi>Jewels</hi> are the product of the <hi>Refiners fire?</hi> the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of this <hi>Refiner,</hi> and <hi>purifier</hi> of ſilver, forming them into Jewels of gold, and Jewels of ſilver, <hi>a people formed for himſelf to ſhew forth his praiſe.</hi>

            <p n="1">1.

               <hi>The loftie looks of man ſhal be humbled, and the haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of men ſhal be bowed down:</hi> it is neceſſary it ſhould be ſo, and the reaſon, why the Lord wil have it ſo, is, <hi>that the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone may be exalted in that day:</hi> it is the great deſign of the Lord in this notable day of his that he is bringing upon Syon, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt himſelf alone; and til this ſelfiſh frame of ſpirit be bowed down and brought low, the Lord cannot accompliſh his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, he cannot be alone exalted: this is the reaſon why the dreadful day of the Lord wil come upon the Cedars, the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of his Temple, becauſe they <hi>are high and lifted up:</hi> but one fragment of this temper of ſpirit, is one of the 7 things that are hateful, &amp; an abomination unto the Lord, <hi>a proud look,</hi> or, <hi>haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie eyes;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov: 6.17.</note> (as the margent of ſome Bibles hath it) O therefore, my brethren, if we would be partakers of the rich Promiſes of the ſparing love of our Father, and not fal under the ſcourging hand of an angry God, in this day of the Lord that is coming upon us, let us dread and flee a ſelf-exalting ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Seeing it is the deſigne of the Lord at this day, to bring his Syon into her firſt ſtate, into the purity of the day of her Eſpouſals; <hi>let us in the name of the Lord, with heart and hand joyn with one accord, to further this glorious deſign of God:</hi> O that we would n deavour every one to mend one, and in love help to

I know you would; why, this is the ready way, the high way, to carry on the great and glorious deſign of God upon the world: when Syon is ſo reformed by the power of God, as that ſhe can offer up Offerings in righteouſneſs, that are peaſant unto the Lord, <hi>as in the daies of old, as in antient Years,</hi> THEN ſhal ſhe tread down the Wicked as aſhes under her feet: THEN <hi>will the Lord raiſe up thy Sons O</hi> Syon,<note place="margin">Zack. 9.13.14, 15.</note>
